To localize the xlast file:

1.  Make sure americanXLAST.txt is writable (i.e. check it out from AB).
    Run strings.bat to extract the latest English strings from the xlast in to
    americanXLAST.txt.
    Check in americanXLAST.txt.

2. Make sure the following files exist in gta\build\common\text\:

americanXLAST_DE.txt
americanXLAST_ES.txt
americanXLAST_FR.txt
americanXLAST_IT.txt

3.  Make sure each of those files is in UTF-8 format.  It's likely that a
    conversion will be necessary.

4.  Check out gta\gta_bin\gta_xenon\xlast\Fuzzy.xlast (or otherwise make it writable).
    This file should be in UTF-16LE format.

5.  Make sure perl is installed and is in the executable path.

6.  Run localize.bat.

7.  Run "strings all" to normalize the formats of all the americanXLAST files.

There should be no errors generated when running the scripts.  If errors occur
it usually signifies a file format error (i.e. one of the source files is not in
the expected format).
